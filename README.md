# Quantization_LLM_Generation
In the given notebook, the decision to employ 4-bit quantization for various models is for an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Quantization involves converting the model's numerical precision from a higher (e.g., 32-bit floating point) to a lower precision, in this case, 4-bit integers.
